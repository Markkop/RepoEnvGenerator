This app is an enhanced version of [MarcoWorms/RefactorGPT](https://github.com/MarcoWorms/RefactorGPT) with the following extra features:

- Allow the use of an access token to access private repositories
- Remember the last used repository in the browser's local storage
- Has a button to copy the generated files text content

---

The refactor and new implementations were mostly made by AI using only ChatGPT and [Genie VSCode Extensions](https://github.com/ai-genie/chatgpt-vscode).
