This app is an enhanced version of [MarcoWorms/RefactorGPT](https://github.com/MarcoWorms/RefactorGPT) with the following extra features:

- Dark theme
- Merged files copy button
- Access to private repositories with an access token
- External link to generate key/token
- Show/hide key/token
- Remember the last used repository
- Streamed response from OpenAI API
- Error handling and loading states

The refactor and new implementations were mostly made by AI using only ChatGPT and [Genie VSCode Extensions](https://github.com/ai-genie/chatgpt-vscode).
